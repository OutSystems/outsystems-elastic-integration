# How to set up the example "Performance SLOs" dashboard

This dashboard is an example of how one could set up SLOs, monitor them at a glance and track their trend over time.

1. [Set up the Transform in Elasticsearch](../elasticsearch/transforms/README.md).
2. Import the `performance-dashboard-export.ndjson` dashboard and all contained visualizations and index patterns. See how to do it [here](../kibana/dashboards/README.md).
3. Open the newly imported dashboard `[OS] Performance SLOs` and select an application.
