# Understand OutSystems monitoring data

We consider "OutSystems monitoring data" to be:
- Logs generated by the OutSystems platform. Logs of the platform itself, but also from the applications that run on top of it.
- Performance events captured by the platform
    > Please be aware that performance events are only captured for OutSystems Traditional Web applications.
