# outsystems-elastic-integration üöÄ

## About üìë
This repository contains [Elastic](https://elastic.co/) accelerators to provide better and faster insights on top of [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/) monitoring data.

These accelerators are:
- **Elasticsearch definitons**
    - Help to set up indices and their lifecycle policies.
    - See it at [data_storing-elasticsearch](data_storing-elasticsearch)
- **Logstash pipelines**
    - Simplify the ETL of monitoring data from the OutSystems platform.
    - Enrich data to allow building more human-readable visualizations.
    - - See it at [data_storing-elasticsearch](data_storing-elasticsearch)
- **Kibana dashboards**
    - Provide an out-of-the-box set of visualizations that help understand OutSystems applications and platform health, based on their performance and errors.
    - Reduce time to insights (based on OutSystems monitoring data).
    - Improve troubleshooting capabilities.

## Goal üéØ
The major goal of these accelerators is to provide OutSystems customers with an out-of-the-box solution to:
- Easily **observe the OutSystems monitoring data on Elastic with more advanced visualizations**, compared to the ones from the built-in tools of the OutSystems platform.
- Easily search through OutSystems monitoring data, in particular through the OutSystems logs with:
    - Free text search.
    - Selection of visible information.
- **Do more advanced monitoring**, compared to what can be done using the built-in tools of the OutSystems platform. Things like:
    - Build alerts for an OutSystems environment or OutSystems Factory.
    - Leverage Elastic analytic capabilities to have deeper insights on performance and behaviour of applications, and the platform itself.
- **Observe OutSystems applications performance and errors through time**.
    - Quickly pinpoint performance bottlenecks, areas to improve, etc.
    - Figure out what is affecting performance:
        - Slow Queries
        - Slow Integrations
        - Slow Extensions
- Provide an example of how to **set up and monitor SLOs**.


<br>

## Outcomes ‚úÖ
- Fast and efficient set up of advanced monitoring and observability solution with a free version. But also with support from Elastic and/or OutSystems Professional Services
- Fast detection of performance and availability issues (of potential or existing)
- Lower troubleshooting times
- Increase the insights to continuously improve your applications and factory through a data drive approach.

## Examples of metrics can you measure
Here are some examples of OutSystems metrics that can be monitored using these accelerators:
- **Request Time Duration** (for each request):
    - Client Time (load time)
    - Server Time, which can be decomposed into:
        - SAT (Session Acquisition Time)
        - Query Execution Time
        - Integration Execution Time
        - Extension Execution Time
- **Server side performance metrics**
    - Session size
    - Viewstate size
    - Number of slow queries
    - Number of slow integrations
    - Number of slow extensions
- **Errors metrics**
    - Number of errors
    - Number of errors by type

> These metrics are the ones that **OutSystems Professional Services Experts** teams consider to be a starting point to understand applications and platform performance.

> As stated, these are just examples of some metrics that can be monitored, based on the platform data.
